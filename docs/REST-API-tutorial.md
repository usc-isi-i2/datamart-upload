# Datamart REST API Tutorial

We have created a full tutorial illustrating how to use the REST API and and the responses following the Datamart schemas.

The latest version of the tutorial is available as an [executable Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/usc-isi-i2/datamart-api/blob/master/Datamart%20Data%20API%20Demo.ipynb), in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/usc-isi-i2/datamart-api)
